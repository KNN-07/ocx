The missing package manager for OpenCode extensions.

Install OpenCode extensions with automatic dependency resolution, config merging, and integrity verification.

## Installation

OCX supports macOS (x64, Apple Silicon), Linux (x64, arm64), and Windows (x64).

```bash
# Install script (macOS and Linux) - recommended
curl -fsSL https://ocx.kdco.dev/install.sh | sh

# Or install via npm
npm install -g ocx

# Windows users: Download binaries from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/kdcokenny/ocx/releases
```

The install script handles PATH configuration automatically or prints instructions if manual setup is needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize OCX in your project
ocx init

# 2. Add the KDCO registry
ocx registry add https://registry.kdco.dev --name kdco

# 3. Add the workspace bundle
ocx add kdco/workspace
```

After installation, OCX will manage components in your `.opencode/` directory, where you can freely customize them to match your project's needs.

### Create Your Own Registry

Scaffold a complete registry with one-click deploy support:

```bash
npx ocx init --registry my-registry
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--namespace <name>` | Registry namespace (default: directory name) |
| `--author <name>` | Author name (default: git user.name) |
| `--local <path>` | Use custom local template |
| `--canary` | Use latest from main branch |
| `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompts |

See [examples/registry-starter](./examples/registry-starter) for the full template with deploy buttons for Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify.

## What OCX Handles

- **npm Dependencies** — Plugins need packages? Installed automatically. No manual `package.json` editing.
- **MCP Servers** — Registered to your config with one command. No manual JSON.
- **Config Merging** — Components bring settings that merge safely with yours.
- **Lockfiles** — Track versions, verify integrity with SHA-256 hashes.
- **Dependency Resolution** — Component A needs B? Both installed in correct order.
- **Own Your Code** — Everything lives in `.opencode/`. Customize freely.

## Auditable by Default

Every component is version-pinned and verified by SHA-256 hash. Before updating, see exactly what changed:

```bash
ocx diff kdco/workspace-plugin
```

- **Detect** — See every upstream change before updating
- **Verify** — SHA-256 hashes catch tampering
- **Pin** — Lockfiles prevent silent updates
- **Audit** — Code lives in your repo, not fetched at runtime

*Your AI agent never runs code you haven't reviewed.*

## Philosophy

OCX follows the **ShadCN model**: components are copied into your project, not hidden in `node_modules`. You own the code—customize freely.

Like **Cargo**, OCX resolves dependencies, pins versions, and verifies integrity. Unlike traditional package managers, everything is auditable and local.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ocx add <component>` | Install a component |
| `ocx update [component]` | Update to latest version |
| `ocx diff [component]` | Show upstream changes |
| `ocx registry add <url>` | Add a registry |

[Full CLI Reference →](./docs/CLI.md)

**Looking for the KDCO registry?** See [workers/kdco-registry](./workers/kdco-registry) for components like `kdco/workspace`, `kdco/researcher`, and more.

## Project structure

OCX manages components within the `.opencode/` directory of your project:

```
.opencode/
├── agent/            # Subagents (researcher, scribe)
├── plugin/           # Project plugins (workspace tools, rule injection)
├── skill/            # Reusable instructions (protocols, philosophies)
├── command/          # Custom TUI commands
├── tool/             # Custom tool implementations
└── philosophy/       # Mandatory project rules
```

## Configuration

### `ocx.jsonc`
The user-editable configuration file.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://ocx.kdco.dev/schema.json",
  "registries": {
    "kdco": {
      "url": "https://registry.kdco.dev"
    }
  },
  "lockRegistries": false
}
```

### `ocx.lock`
Auto-generated lockfile tracking installed versions, hashes, and targets.
