## Code Philosophy - MANDATORY

Before writing or modifying any code, you MUST:

1. Load the relevant philosophy skills using the `skill` tool:
   - **`kdco-code-philosophy`**: The 5 Laws of Elegant Defense
   - **`kdco-frontend-philosophy`**: The 5 Pillars of Intentional UI

2. Verify your implementation against the philosophy checklist BEFORE completing your task

3. If your code violates any philosophy principle, refactor it before proceeding

This is NOT optional. These philosophies define how code must be written in this project. All plans and implementations must align with these principles.
